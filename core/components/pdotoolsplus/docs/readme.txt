pdoToolsPlus is an extension for pdoTools. It provides a new approach to development - file-based elements. Now you don't need to create chunks, snippets and also templates in the database. Use your favorite IDE. This solution is based on Fenom PHP template engine and more flexible and faster than MODX static elements.
